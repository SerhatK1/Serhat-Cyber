#================================ HTTP Endpoint ======================================
# Each beat can expose internal metrics through a HTTP endpoint. For security

# append ?pretty to the URL.

# Define which user should be owning the named pipe.

#============================== X-Pack Monitoring ===============================
# metricbeat can export internal metrics to a central Elasticsearch monitoring
# cluster.  This requires xpack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
#monitoring.enabled: false

# Sets the UUID of the Elasticsearch cluster under which monitoring data for this
# Metricbeat instance will appear in the Stack Monitoring UI. If output.elasticsearch
